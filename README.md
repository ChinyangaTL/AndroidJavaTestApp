# AndroidJavaTestApp

Code is in the other branch cause I'm an idiot who can't use Android Studio.

After fooling around with a the documentation and a few other resources, I just tried to throw something to the wall to see if I can build something with this.
Initial thoughts, do not enjoy the workflow (Java being a large part of that), but it is what it is. 
It's not terrible, but at least at this level, it doesn't feel like this is the way I should be building components, I guess I've been spoilt by React JS.
Bare bones and basic, rudimentary and I wasn't focused on design; buy yeah, lots of work to be done like responsive design and using proper string resource files, but I think I have a decent idea about the workflow and hopefully with time I'll be able to build half way decent applications. 

Also, http://mathparser.org/, is a godsent.
